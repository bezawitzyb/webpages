      <h2>My Love,</h2>

      <p>
        You once messaged me with a confidence that felt almost bold —
        like you already knew something I hadn’t figured out yet.
        And somehow, you were right.
        From the very beginning, there was a quiet sense of knowing with you —
        a certainty I never questioned.
      </p>

      <p>
        Being with you feels like exhaling.
        You bring calm where there could be chaos,
        laughter where there could be heaviness,
        and steadiness where I sometimes feel unsure.
        With you, I don’t feel like I have to prove myself —
        I feel deeply loved for exactly who I am.
      </p>

      <p>
        From our early dates and long conversations,
        to trips that became pieces of our story —
        Middelburg, Austria, Maastricht, Portugal —
        every memory feels warmer because it has you in it.
        You have a way of making moments feel meaningful
        simply by being fully there with me.
      </p>

      <p>
        What I admire most about you is not only how you love me in joy,
        but how intentionally present you are in the difficult moments.
        You don’t rush me or try to fix me —
        you stand beside me, grounded and patient,
        reminding me through your presence that I am never alone.
        That kind of love is rare.
      </p>

      <p>
        I want you to know how incredibly proud I am of you.
        Of the late nights you spend working toward your goals,
        even when no one sees the effort.
        Of the discipline, focus, and quiet determination
        you bring to turning your vision into reality.
        Watching you build the life you believe in
        inspires me more than you know.
      </p>

      <p>
        I admire your faith deeply —
        the way you commit to it with intention and unwavering discipline.
        Your fasting, your prayers, your consistency
        reflect the strength of your character
        and the depth of your values.
        You lead with purpose, and it shows.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for believing in me,
        especially while I’ve been changing my career
        and stepping into the unknown.
        There were moments when things felt heavy and uncertain,
        and I know — truly —
        that it would not have been as manageable
        without your encouragement, reassurance,
        and steady belief in me.
        You made me feel capable when I doubted myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Loving you feels safe and exciting at the same time.
        I feel chosen, supported, desired, and respected.
        With you, the future feels intentional —
        not rushed, not forced,
        but built with care and faith.
        Choosing you feels natural, steady, and deeply right.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe our prayers are being answered —
        not all at once, but one by one,
        exactly when the timing is right.
        I trust that God is making a way for us,
        shaping our paths,
        and preparing a future
        we will walk into together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for loving me the way you do.
        Thank you for being my partner,
        my calm, my strength, and my home.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Happy Valentine’s Day ❤️</strong></p>
